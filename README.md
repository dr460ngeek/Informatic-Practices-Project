# **INFORMATICS PRACTICES (065) PROJECT**

#### Project for the purpose of Class 12 practicle board exams.
# Project Title: Market sales analysis

#### Problem Definition:

The project has been made to use and check the codes I have learned. There are approximately more than 5 operations done on the selected dataset.

#### Member Detail:

This project is developed by **Pratham Agarwal**. All the operations are completed by me as per my learnings with assistance of my teacher. It took me approximately a month to develop this project.

#### Reason for the project:

The reason behind choosing this Topic is The growth of supermarkets in most populated cities are increasing and market competitions are also high. In a Super Market Store, customers shop from properly labelled racks, and at the end of the store, there is a cashier who takes the money after weighing and inspecting the goods. Customers typically make purchases and transport them in trolleys. So, supermarkets are known as self-service stores because customers are expected to do all of their shopping without the assistance of salespeople or sales assistants. I also find the topic very interesting.
